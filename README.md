**Cairn** is a fork of the [MeshCore](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore) companion firmware. Every board is built from one source tree that shares MeshCore's mesh and radio code, and every build works with the official MeshCore apps ([web](https://app.meshcore.nz), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.liamcottle.meshcore.android), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meshcore/id6742354151)).

Builds are numbered: the splash screen shows **BUILD N**, releases are tagged `cairn-vN`, and files are named `MeshCore-<Board>-CairnN-<date>…`, so you can match a device to a release from its own screen.

**Download the files from the [latest release](https://github.com/cvhviz/Cairn/releases/latest).** L1 releases from before Cairn are in the [older L1 repository](https://github.com/cvhviz/WioL1Pro-CVHBuild).

## Latest: Cairn 112 (9 Oct 2026)

- **Settings as tiles:** every Settings page now uses tiles like the Settings root: two across, each with an icon, its name and its value. A tap flips a switch on its tile; other values open a small sheet.
- **Screensaver** (Settings › Appearance › Screensaver): Beacon, Ambient, Night clock or Auto, for a screen set never to time out.
- **Notices in the status bar:** a new message or a saved setting tints the status bar for a moment instead of covering the page. When a notice leads somewhere, a tap on it opens it.
- **Updater mode** (was "update mode"): send an update over Wi-Fi from a browser; with the next CairnOS update, the app can start one over Bluetooth once you tap Allow on the board.
- **Sent messages sync:** messages sent from a phone app appear in the board's chats, and messages sent on the board appear in CairnOS.
- **Quick panel:** Radio · Theme · Settings buttons along the bottom.
- **M9 and T-Deck:** the keys reach each card in the Nodes Cards view, and the keyboard light goes dark sooner on battery. The T-Deck's Battery saver roughly doubles screen-off standby (about 54 h instead of 28 h).
- **T-Display SF32** (from 108): a mini spectrum in the Home header, Settings as cards, the nine themes, larger text and colour emoji, sent-message sync, Wake on motion, and a power switch that turns the docked board off on battery. See its [board page](docs/boards/lilygo-t-display-sf32.md).
- **Updating:** L2 Pro, Heltec V4 touch, ThinkNode M9, T-Deck and T-Display SF32 update over Wi-Fi in **Settings › System › Firmware update**. The T096 companion and the compact repeaters are rebuilt as Cairn 112 with no functional changes.
- **Other boards:** the L1 Pro and the preview boards stay on [Cairn 107](https://github.com/cvhviz/Cairn/releases/tag/cairn-v107).

Cairn 111 added nine themes, a QR code for sharing contacts, GPS data and the path hash setting; see its [release notes](https://github.com/cvhviz/Cairn/releases/tag/cairn-v111).

## Supported boards

✅ **Tested**: used on real hardware before each release. ✅ **Beta**: tested on hardware but new to Cairn; its page lists what hasn't been tried yet. 🧪 **Preview**: builds from the same tree but hasn't been tried on hardware. Reports are welcome.

The standard MeshCore repeater with a minimal Cairn screen: Status, Spectrum and a few Settings on the one button, and a power save that keeps the screen and TX LED off until a double-click. Holding the button on Status (~3 s, then release) turns it off; a press turns it back on. The screens below are simulated with fictional sample data.

### Coming soon

- **Map downloads on the device**, straight over Wi-Fi, so you won't need a computer to prepare the offline map card. Until then, [tools/maptiles.py](tools/maptiles.py) builds the card on a computer.

## Which file do I need?

Each release carries every board's files, named `MeshCore-<Board>-CairnN-<date>[-<variant>].<ext>`. Your board page lists them all.

| You want to…      | nRF52840 boards       | ESP32 boards                         | T-Display SF32                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **First install** | the board's `.uf2`    | `-full.bin` at `0x0` ⚠               | the `-install.zip`: unzip, double-click |
| **Update**        | the board's `.uf2`    | `-update.bin` at `0x10000`, or Wi-Fi | the `-install.zip` again, or Wi-Fi      |
| **Recover**       | copy the `.uf2` again | erase, then `-full.bin` at `0x0`     | hold A for 12 s, then the installer     |

- ⚠ An ESP32 first install erases the device. If it runs MeshCore, export your identity and contacts in the app first. Updates keep everything.
- On ESP32 boards, write the `-full.bin` or the `-update.bin`, never both.
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` in each release covers every file: `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt`.

## Wio Tracker L2 Pro: brochure, manual and screens

- [Cairn brochure (PDF)](docs/Cairn_Wio_L2_Pro_Brochure.pdf): the firmware, the board and the 3D-printed case, in nine pages.
- [Cairn user manual (PDF)](docs/Cairn_Wio_L2_Pro_User_Manual.pdf): every screen and setting, explained step by step. The offline-map tool it mentions is [tools/maptiles.py](tools/maptiles.py) ([how to use it](tools/MAPTILES.md)).
- The touch features are listed on the [L2 Pro board page](docs/boards/wio-tracker-l2-pro.md). The Heltec V4 touch, ThinkNode M9 and T-Deck run the same interface.

[![Cairn on the Wio Tracker L2 Pro](docs/promo/01_cairn_hero.jpg)](docs/promo/01_cairn_hero.jpg)

More promo images (free to share) are in [docs/promo](docs/promo). **All 19 screens**, one by one: [L2 Pro board page](docs/boards/wio-tracker-l2-pro.md#screens).

## Screens on other boards

### ThinkNode M9 and T-Deck

The same interface on the [ThinkNode M9](docs/boards/thinknode-m9.md), driven by its keys, and on the [T-Deck](docs/boards/lilygo-t-deck.md), by touch, keyboard and trackball. Captured on the devices.

## Reporting a problem

[Open an issue](https://github.com/cvhviz/Cairn/issues/new/choose) and pick **Bug report**. The form asks for the board, the build number from the splash screen, how you installed it, and what happened. A serial log helps a lot. Reports on 🧪 preview boards are especially useful, including "it works".

## Publishing a release (for the online updater)

The L2, Heltec V4 touch, ThinkNode M9, T-Deck and T-Display SF32 builds read `https://api.github.com/repos/cvhviz/Cairn/releases/latest`. For a build to be offered:

- Tag it `cairn-vN`, where N is the build number shown on the splash (it must be higher than the device's own). Publish it as a normal release, not a draft or prerelease.
- Attach each board's `-update.bin` under its exact name, with nothing between the date and `-update.bin`. The SF32 also accepts a `.sha256` file next to its update.
- GitHub records each file's SHA-256, which the device checks, along with the size and the board's OTA marker inside the image.
- No other asset may start with one of these board prefixes and end in `-update.bin`. Preview boards use their own board names.
- The release notes are shown on the device before installing, so keep the top of them short and plain.

| Board           | Update file                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| L2 Pro          | `MeshCore-WioL2Pro-CairnN-YYYY-MM-DD-update.bin`      |
| Heltec V4 touch | `MeshCore-HeltecV4Touch-CairnN-YYYY-MM-DD-update.bin` |
| ThinkNode M9    | `MeshCore-ThinkNodeM9-CairnN-YYYY-MM-DD-update.bin`   |
| T-Deck          | `MeshCore-TDeckPlus-CairnN-YYYY-MM-DD-update.bin`     |
| T-Display SF32  | `MeshCore-TDisplaySF32-CairnN-YYYY-MM-DD-update.bin`  |

## Relationship to upstream

This is a personal build, not a general-purpose distribution. All core mesh and radio behaviour comes from [MeshCore](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore). See that project for protocol documentation, the official flasher, its own list of supported hardware and the client apps. Cairn tracks MeshCore releases; the release notes say which version each build is based on. Credit to the MeshCore developers and community for the foundation.

## License
