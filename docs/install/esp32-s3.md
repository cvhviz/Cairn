# Installing on ESP32-S3 boards (esptool or web flasher)

For the Wio Tracker L2 Pro, the Heltec V4 touch build, the Elecrow ThinkNode M9, the LilyGO T-Deck and the ESP32 [preview boards](../boards/preview-boards.md).

Each ESP32 board has two files in a release:

| File | Use | Written at | Keeps your data? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MeshCore-<Board>-CairnN-<date>[-<variant>]-full.bin` | first install, or recovery | `0x0`, after a full erase | **No: erases everything** |
| `MeshCore-<Board>-CairnN-<date>[-<variant>]-update.bin` | update a device already on Cairn | `0x10000` | Yes |

For example, the ThinkNode M9's are `MeshCore-ThinkNodeM9-CairnN-<date>-full.bin` and `MeshCore-ThinkNodeM9-CairnN-<date>-update.bin`.

**Flash only the `-full.bin` for a first install, never both.** The `-full.bin` already contains the app; writing the `-update.bin` after it isn't needed. Coming from stock MeshCore or other firmware, use the `-full.bin`: its partition layout may not match Cairn's.

## Before a first install: back up your identity

A first install erases the whole flash: the node's private key, contacts, channels and settings, and any factory firmware. If the board already runs MeshCore and you want to keep its identity, **export the private key and your contacts in the MeshCore app first** (Settings in the app). You can import them again after installing.

## Download mode

Most boards enter download mode on their own when esptool or the web flasher connects. If a board doesn't:

| Board | Buttons |
|---|---|
| Elecrow ThinkNode M9 | none: download mode is automatic through its USB-serial chip, and it has no Boot button. If it doesn't connect, unplug and replug the cable and try again. |
| LilyGO T-Deck / T-Deck Plus | switch it off, hold the **trackball** in (it is BOOT), switch it on, release |
| Wio Tracker L2 Pro | hold **Boot**, tap **Reset**, release **Boot** |
| Heltec V4 (touch or OLED), V3, Wireless Tracker | hold **PRG** (also labelled USER), tap **RST**, release **PRG** |
| Most other boards | hold **BOOT** (or IO0), tap **RST** / **EN**, release **BOOT** |

After writing, tap Reset once if the screen still shows the old firmware.

## Option 1: web flasher (Chrome or Edge)

1. Open [Espressif's web flasher](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/) and click **Connect**. Pick the board's serial port.
2. **First install or recovery:** click **Erase Flash** and wait for it to finish. Then set the address to `0x0`, choose the `-full.bin`, and click **Program**.
3. **Update:** set the address to `0x10000`, choose the `-update.bin`, and click **Program**. Don't erase.
4. Click **Disconnect**, then tap Reset on the board.

## Option 2: esptool (command line)

esptool v5 is shown here. `pip install esptool` (or `pipx install esptool`) installs it.

```bash
# first install or recovery
esptool --chip esp32s3 erase-flash
esptool --chip esp32s3 -b 921600 write-flash 0x0 MeshCore-<Board>-CairnN-<date>-full.bin

# update
esptool --chip esp32s3 -b 921600 write-flash 0x10000 MeshCore-<Board>-CairnN-<date>-update.bin
```

The older form still works: `esptool.py --chip esp32s3 erase_flash`, `esptool.py ... write_flash 0x10000 ...`. Add `-p <port>` if more than one serial device is connected. If writes fail at 921600, use `-b 460800`.

### If the device last updated over Wi-Fi

An L2, Heltec V4, ThinkNode M9 or T-Deck that installed its last update over Wi-Fi may be running from its second app slot, and a USB write to `0x10000` would then be ignored at boot. Clear the boot selector first, then write the update:

```bash
esptool --chip esp32s3 erase-region 0xe000 0x2000
esptool --chip esp32s3 -b 921600 write-flash 0x10000 MeshCore-<Board>-CairnN-<date>-update.bin
```

This keeps your identity and settings. Writing the `-full.bin` after a full erase also works, but erases everything.

### Original ESP32 boards

A few preview boards (Heltec V2, the LilyGO T-Beam with SX1262 or SX1276, T-LoRa V2.1, MeshAdventurer) use the original ESP32. Use `--chip esp32` instead of `--chip esp32s3`, or leave `--chip` out and let esptool detect it. The offsets are the same: `-full.bin` at `0x0`, `-update.bin` at `0x10000`.

The [compact repeater](../boards/compact-repeater.md) images for the Heltec V2, V3, V4, V4-R8 and Wireless Tracker install the same way: `-repeater-full.bin` at `0x0` for a first install, `-repeater-update.bin` at `0x10000` to update. They don't update over Wi-Fi.

## Over Wi-Fi (L2 Pro, Heltec V4 touch, ThinkNode M9, T-Deck)

- **Online:** Settings › System › Firmware update › **Check for updates**. The device also checks this repository once a day while on Wi-Fi and shows a notice when a newer build is out. It downloads the board's `-update.bin` over HTTPS, checks its size, SHA-256 and board marker, and installs only after you confirm.
- **Updater mode:** tap the **Updater mode** tile on the same page (called update mode before Cairn 112). The board shows its address and a password. Open that address in a browser, type the password, and upload the `-update.bin`.

  Bluetooth is off while Updater mode runs, and the board restarts into the new build when it's done.
- **From CairnOS** (Cairn 112, with the next CairnOS update): the app can ask the board over Bluetooth to start Updater mode. The board asks **Allow app update?** first; after you tap Allow it turns Bluetooth off and the app sends the update over Wi-Fi. The board must be on Wi-Fi.

## First boot

The first boot after a full erase sits on "Loading..." for a while as it formats storage and creates the node's identity. Leave it alone; it then shows the home screen. Pair from the MeshCore app with the PIN shown on the screen.

## Troubleshooting

**Blank screen or boot loop after installing.** The wrong build for the board revision is the usual cause. Check what the chip reports:

```bash
esptool flash-id       # older esptool: esptool.py flash_id
```

`flash-id` prints the chip line (type, revision and features such as *Embedded PSRAM 8MB*) and the *Detected flash size*. `esptool chip-id` (older: `chip_id`) prints the chip line without the flash size.

The **Heltec V4 touch build needs a V4-R8** (reports *Embedded PSRAM 8MB*; 16 MB flash, octal PSRAM) **fitted in the Expansion Kit V2** (2.8" touchscreen). A standard V4 reports *2MB* PSRAM and needs the `HeltecV4` [preview build](../boards/preview-boards.md); on a standard V4 the touch image's octal PSRAM setup fails and the board boot-loops. A V4-R8 with only the OLED needs the `HeltecV4R8` preview build. The L2 Pro has 16 MB flash and 8 MB PSRAM on its Wio-S3 module.

**esptool can't connect.** Put the board in download mode by hand (see above), try another cable or USB port, and close anything else holding the serial port (the MeshCore web app, a serial monitor, another flasher tab). The ThinkNode M9 has no download-mode buttons: replug it instead, and on Windows install WCH's CH340 driver if no COM port appears.

**The old firmware still runs after an update.** Tap Reset. If it still does, the device was probably on its second app slot: see [If the device last updated over Wi-Fi](#if-the-device-last-updated-over-wi-fi).

**Still stuck?** Erase and write the `-full.bin` (this erases everything), then [report it](https://github.com/cvhviz/Cairn/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) with the board, the build number and a serial log.
